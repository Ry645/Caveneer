A funny game about momentum.  

You can play the game in your browser here (TODO),  
And download the compiled game here (TODO).  

You can also build the game from source.  
To do that, [install Godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/download/).  
Pull from my repository into a folder.  
Import the project from the folder, open it, and click on the triangle "play button" in the top right corner of the editor pane.  
You can also export the project into an executable; click on "Project" and "Export" in the top left corner.  

Modify the project in any way you want to!  
Excuse my pseudo-spaghetti code.  

Either way,  
Have fun.
