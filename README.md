A funny game about momentum.

To compile the game from source, [install Godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/download/).  
Open the project, and click on the triangle "play button" in the top right corner of the editor pane.  
You can also export the project into an executable; click on "Project" and "Export" in the top left corner.

You can also play the game in your browser here (TODO),  
And download the game here (TODO).  

Either way,  
Have fun.
