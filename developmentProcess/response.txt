In short:
Caveneer makes use of levers to reveal secret areas the player can travel through.
The game's introduction and atmosphere is dark and mysterious.
The cave is sentient for some unknown reason.
The player can discover secret tricks to improve their speedruns.
There's also a secret rank, guarded by a funny number.

Now for the long answer.
Origininally, my game plan was to create a procedurally generated dungeon-crawler, in which the main upgrades were hidden in secret rooms.
However, that soon proved to be virtually impossible given the time constraints and my other responsibilities, so I settled for a smaller scope.

I kept the concept of hidden rooms in my game, but I did away with procedural generation.
Instead, I revealed hidden game objects to the player.
The player would flick a lever, and they would suddenly return to see everything changed!

I also kept a mysterious vibe throughout the game, instilled by the game's introduction.
I also gave the cave a bit of a hidden personality.

I remember trying really hard to fiddle around with my player's grappling movement to encourage preserving momentum (as all grappling hooks should).
Sometime in my process, I decided to just add a button that redirects the player's velocity at will.
The movement felt great immideitly, so I banked in on that feature.

I designed 6 levels around the player's dashing mechanic, which was really fun to play around with.
Most of the mechanics I created came straight from level design, as I thought up of new and clever ways to ultilize the player's abilities.
