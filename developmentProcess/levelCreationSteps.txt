1:
	start by drawing a bunch of level sections that I can put together
	make good notation that communicates clearly what each object is
	DO NOT RELY ON REMEMBERING IT LATER
2:
	create the level procedurally
	after adding in all the levers and doors, I should have a finished project
	
	DO NOT CREATE THE PROPS AND CONNECT IT ALL AT THE END
		
		connecting it at the end takes much longer than doing it while adding in the props
3:
	test the level for any bugs
