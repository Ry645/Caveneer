There it is.
That entrance.

This is the cave the world shuns.
Anyone who enters...

Never returns.

And yet,
The cave beckons to me.

It promises a level of elation I cannot comprehend.

Infinite treasures, infinite challenges.

Infinite secrets.

I don't have much of my life left.

I've lost everything.
All but my trusty grappling hook.

And now, I only wonder.

What else can I lose?
My sanity?
My life?

Well...

Past the nebulous tunnel,

There's only one way to find out.
