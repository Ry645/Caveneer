walk around in an endless field (plains biome)
dig up entrances to caves, and later dungeons
inspired by first legend of zelda game's inspiration miyamoto exploring caves
also inspired by endoparasitic 2

check props and sus spots for caves

first cave is one or two rooms with small amounts of resources
gather resources from first cave
all resources gathered from caves

use resources to unlock the ability to open the next cave type
this cave has more rooms and a few enemies

optional:
idk make a treasure/crystal at the very end and have an escape sequence
cave/dungeon is caving in and falling apart
